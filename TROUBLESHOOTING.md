## Network Errors

### Error: Service not accessible

**Symptom**: The service is not accessible at the expected URL.

**Cause**: The service is not running or the port is not properly exposed.

**Solution**:
1. Check if the service is running using `docker-compose ps`.
2. Check if the port is properly exposed in the Docker Compose configuration file.
3. Check if there is a firewall blocking the port.
4. Restart the service.

### Error: WebSocket connection failed

**Symptom**: The WebSocket connection fails to establish.

**Cause**: The WebSocket server is not running or the WebSocket connection is blocked.

## PWA Installation Issues

### Error: PWA not installable

**Symptom**: The PWA is not installable in the browser.

## Deterministic Troubleshooting Tools

The following tools can be used to diagnose and fix issues with the Jellicule UI library:

1. **Docker Compose Logs**: Use `docker-compose logs` to view the logs of the service.
2. **Health Check Dashboard**: Access the health dashboard at `http://localhost:7327/dashboard` to check the health of the service.
3. **Browser Developer Tools**: Use the browser developer tools to inspect the web components and check for any error messages in the console.
4. **Curl**: Use `curl http://localhost:7327/health` to check the health of the service programmatically.
5. **Docker Stats**: Use `docker stats` to monitor the resource usage of the Docker containers.
